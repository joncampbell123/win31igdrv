; This is the data for the other tournament players.
; In the first section, various skill levels are calculated.
; In the second section, these skill levels and names 
; are assigned to players.

; (1) Calculate levels of play
; 
; There are 5 skill levels: 
;      LEVEL5, LEVEL4, LEVEL3, LEVEL2, and LEVEL1. 
; Skill levels affect the outcome by determining the 
; probabilities of getting various scores.
; The general equation looks like this:
;      LEVEL[level number]=[Eagle],[Birdie],[Par],[Bogey],
;      [Double Bogey],[Triple Bogey],[4 over],[5 over],
;      [6 over],[7 over or more]
; For example, this expression defines the LEVEL5 player:
;     LEVEL5=95,60,20,10,5,4,3,2,1
; The player can make an Eagle 100-95 or 5 percent, a 
; Birdie 95-60 or 40 percent, etc.  
; The complete table of his scores follows:
;                                Probability of
;    Score           Assigned #     occurrence
;    --------------------------------------------------
;    Eagle            100 - 95        5%
;    Birdie            95 - 60       35%
;    Par               60 - 20       40%
;    Bogey             20 - 10       10%
;    Double Bogey      10 -  5        5%
;    Triple Bogey       5 -  4        1%
;    4 over             4 -  3        1%
;    5 over             3 -  2        1%
;    6 over             2 -  1        1%
;    7 over or more     1 -  0        1%
;    --------------------------------------------------
; In the table below, LEVEL5 is the highest skill level.

LEVEL5=95,60,20,10,5,4,3,2,1
LEVEL4=98,70,30,20,15,8,6,4,1
LEVEL3=99,80,40,20,10,5,3,2,1
LEVEL2=99,90,50,40,30,20,10,5,3
LEVEL1=99,95,80,50,45,40,30,20,10

; (2) Assign names and levels of play to tournament players
; 
; Expression is:
;      MAN[person number]=[skill level],[person name]

;      MAN1=5,Chiki Nagai
; Tournament player #1 is named "Chiki Nagai".
; His skill level is level 5 (LEVEL5), as defined above.
