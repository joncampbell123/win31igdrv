L1=Impact
L3=Geoffrey Lee designed this face, first issued in 1965 by the famous Sheffield
L4=foundry, Stephenson Blake. The mid-1960s marked the height of a fashion for
L5=bold condensed faces that probably originated when Paris Match cut up prints of
L6=the Schmalfette Grotesk font, which had been drawn by Walter Haettenschweiler. 
L8=Because Impact was less condensed than Schmalfette, designers often used the two
L9=fonts together as companion faces. Even without Schmalfette, you can use Impact
L10=for, well, impact.
