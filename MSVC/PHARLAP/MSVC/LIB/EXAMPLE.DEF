;
; GORUN286.EXE is Phar Lap's default stub program for programs
; that use 286|DOS-Extender.  GORUN286 spawns RUN286.EXE, and directs
; the DOS-Extender to load the application.  We find this much
; more useful than printing out an error message.  LINK.EXE requires
; that GORUN286.EXE be found in your PATH environment varaible.
STUB 'gorun286.exe'		; Convenient, not required

;
; BCC286_EXE is used to trigger certain responses in RUN286.EXE, with
; respect to floating-point emulation.  The name of this symbol *will*
; change in the next release.  This export is only required for programs
; that use floating-point emulation code.
