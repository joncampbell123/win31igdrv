This Addendum, together with the Phar Lap Software, Inc. ("Phar Lap") 
Binary License Agreement, applies only to the use of the Phar Lap 
example code and programs (the "Example Code") contained in the 
\EXAMPLES directory of the Phar Lap distribution disks.  Some products 
may contain Example Code on separate disks labelled "examples" in 
addition to or in place of the \EXAMPLES directory; this addendum 
applies to any such Example Code, directories and disks, regardless of 
the manner or media on which they are provided.

In addition to the permitted uses set forth in the Binary License 
Agreement, you may:

   Incorporate "Example Code" in any program(s) you develop; however, 
   you may so incorporate only the object code form, and not the 
   source code form, of the Example Code into any program(s) you 
   develop which are distributed, sublicensed or otherwise 
   transferred by or for you to any person, entity or organization.  
   You may not incorporate in any program(s) you develop, for any 
   purpose whatsoever, any other code or programs or any portion of 
   code or programs contained in any other directory on the 
   distribution disks.
