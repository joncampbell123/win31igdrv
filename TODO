DOSBOX Graphics driver:
[DONE]
- Most programs including VIDEDIT, XINGMPEG, and the DOSLIB display test programs,
  are crashing when attempting to show an image. This is worse than when I was
  initiailly developing the driver when they all worked, and the only crash was
  DIBVIEW with an odd-width bitmap. Use GIT to bisect when programs using
  SetDIBits or DIB related functions started crashing so badly.
- Very rarely, especially during Windows 3.1 startup, it is still possible for the
  cursor movement to leave behind "mouse droppings" probably due to DOSBox IG bank
  switching. I noticed in the debugger that when Windows calls the driver to draw
  the mouse, interrupts are enabled, so perhaps the ISR comes around again before
  the cursor drawing is finished to operate. Does the cursor routine need a bank
  switching guard against itself? Maybe DrawCursor interrupted another part of the
  cursor code and setting the bank to zero screws up drawing?
[TODO]
- Initially the only crash was in DIBVIEW when opening the "odd width" test samples.
- Hm... The DOSLIB programs to display a bitmap crash for anything higher than about
  800x600 if you scroll. If I had to guess, the fancy optimization in the code about
  how most bitmaps lie within the first 3 segments and something about avoiding the
  divide instruction through iteration might be at fault here.
- Bank switching. Video modes about 800x600 are not usable because the driver
  stays within a 64KB video memory region. To go above that resolution, all code
  will need to use bank switching. That includes cursor drawing code. Which by the
  way will need to save/restore the bank switching offsets so DOSBox-X needs to be
  updated to make the bank switching registers readable. The cursor code needs to
  use the very last bytes of video memory for the cursor buffering code.
