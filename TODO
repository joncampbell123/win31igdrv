DOSBOX Graphics driver:
- Most programs including VIDEDIT, XINGMPEG, and the DOSLIB display test programs,
  are crashing when attempting to show an image. This is worse than when I was
  initiailly developing the driver when they all worked, and the only crash was
  DIBVIEW with an odd-width bitmap. Use GIT to bisect when programs using
  SetDIBits or DIB related functions started crashing so badly.
- Initially the only crash was in DIBVIEW when opening the "odd width" test samples.
- Bank switching. Video modes about 800x600 are not usable because the driver
  stays within a 64KB video memory region. To go above that resolution, all code
  will need to use bank switching. That includes cursor drawing code. Which by the
  way will need to save/restore the bank switching offsets so DOSBox-X needs to be
  updated to make the bank switching registers readable. The cursor code needs to
  use the very last bytes of video memory for the cursor buffering code.
